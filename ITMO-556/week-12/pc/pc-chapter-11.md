# Podcast Questions - Chapter 11

Watch this video, *What Is ZFS?: A Brief Primer by Wendell at Level1techs* at [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsFDp-W1Ks0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsFDp-W1Ks0 "youtube for what is ZFS primer") and answer the following questions.

* ~1:10 Which company was the original developers of the ZFS filesystem?
  * The ZFS filesystem was initially created by a group at Sun Microsystems under the direction of Jeff Bonwick, Bill Moore, and Matthew Ahrens.

* ~1:45-2:15 What was Sun's problem with their advanced technology?
  * With their cutting-edge technologies, Sun Microsystems had difficulties, especially with the ZFS file system. ZFS provided cutting-edge features and capabilities, but licensing issues prevented it from being widely used. ZFS's initial release under the CDDL (Common Development and Distribution License) by Sun Microsystems limited its compatibility with Linux distributions because it is incompatible with the GPL (GNU General Public License). Collaboration with the Linux community and broad acceptance were hampered by this licensing issue.

* ~3:00-3:10 What is ZFS "all about"?
  * ZFS is all about using commodity hardware to store files with perfect data integrity. Its main objective is to guarantee data integrity and dependability, particularly with regard to mechanical hard drives.

* ~4:45 How is a Mechanical Harddrive described?
  * A mechanical hard drive is characterized as a "fantastical Rube Goldberg machine of neodymium, copper, and data storage," highlighting its complex and sometimes erratic properties.

* ~5:30-5:455 What formulaic way does ZFS detect data corruption?
  * ZFS employs a checksumming procedure to identify data corruption. Strong redundancy is ensured by storing additional checksum data and employing algorithms to quickly identify changes or inaccuracies in the data.

* ~6:40-7:15 What is the comparison of the increase the CPU power to the increase of disk throughput?
  * The growth in disk throughput has not kept up with the increase in CPU power. Disk throughput has only moderately increased from 100 megabytes per second to approximately 200 megabytes per second, notably with mechanical hard drives, while CPUs have gone to billions of cycles per second.

* ~8:00 What did Sun discover was available while waiting for slower disks?
  * Sun found that there was a chance to make use of CPU computing power while waiting for slower disks. This resulted in the creation of ZFS, which uses computations to search for information while utilizing the slower speed of mechanical hard drives.

* ~8:30 What do most filesystems design have in mind?
  * Multiple physical devices are not typically considered in filesystem designs. As opposed to ZFS, which is made to function well with several physical pieces of hardware, traditional filesystems frequently concentrate on a single item, such a flash drive.

* ~9:01 How is a ZFS designed to operate?
  * ZFS is intended to function as both a volume management and a filesystem. It oversees the storage devices, ensures data integrity via checksums, and improves data management with features like copy-on-write and snapshots.

* ~11:00 How was the original Google Hardware described?
  * It was said that the initial Google gear was "whatever was cheap." Google took a practical approach, emphasizing affordability over the use of pricey, high-end parts.

* ~12:11 The filesystem doesn't know how to deal with multiple physical whats?
  * The filesystem is incapable of handling several physical devices, particularly when it comes to effectively managing data across various disks.

* ~12:30 What is a PCI-e RAID card?
  * A Peripheral Component Interconnect Express (PCI-e) RAID card is made specifically for RAID (redundant array of independent disk) installations. It aids in the management of several disk drives for redundancy, performance, or both.

* ~14:50-16:00 What is a RAID 6 configuration and what does it do for you in regards to disk corruption?
  * Block-level striping is used in RAID 6 configurations to spread parity information among several drives. It offers a higher level of fault tolerance and protection against disk corruption because it can survive the loss of two disk drives without erasing any data.

* ~17:45 Describe how ZFS is philosophically different from RAID controllers (as mentioned in the previous 2-3 minutes)?
  * ZFS integrates volume management and filesystem functions in a holistic manner, which sets it apart from RAID controllers conceptually. It places a strong emphasis on data integrity, detection, and correction, strengthening its resistance to corruption and offering a holistic solution that goes beyond what RAID controllers are generally able to provide.

* ~18:28 How is a ZFS volume defined?
  * Combining several physical devices, such as SSDs or hard disks, into a storage pool defines a ZFS volume. Then, using this pool, filesystems and data management are performed, providing scalability and flexibility in storage management.

* ~19:25 What does ZFS store with its mirrored data?
  * To improve data integrity and management, ZFS saves metadata along with the replicated data, which offers more details about the stored data.

* ~21:57 What are the three attributes of ZFS listed?
  * ZFS is characterized by three key features: copy-on-write; data integrity via checksums; and snapshot creation capability.

* ~22:16 Where does ZFS work best?
  * ZFS functions best in systems that handle sensitive data or enterprise storage solutions where data integrity and dependability are critical.

* ~23:18 How is bit rot defined?
  * Bit rot is the term used to describe how data gradually deteriorates on storage medium, perhaps resulting in information loss or corruption over time.

* ~24:25 How does ZFS compare to Btrfs?
  * Next-generation filesystems like copy-on-write and snapshots are shared by ZFS and Btrfs. Nonetheless, ZFS is sometimes seen as being more established and reliable, having a longer history in production settings.

* ~28:45 What are the host's list of 4 features that ZFS has?
  * Data integrity, copy-on-write, snapshot creation, and automated data corruption correction are the four features of ZFS that the host lists.

* ~29:48 What is the host's conclusion about the reliability of ZFS?
  * The host comes to the conclusion that ZFS is very dependable, particularly in settings where data integrity is crucial. ZFS is a reliable option for storage solutions because of its feature set, which includes checksums, snapshots, and automatic repair.
