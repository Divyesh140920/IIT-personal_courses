# Review Questions - Chapter 02



* Based on the movie's tone and rhetoric - why do you think there was an anti-Microsoft tone at the time of the movies making (~2001)? (You may need to research [Microsoft anti-trust case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Microsoft_Corp. "Anti-Trust") ).

  * The anti-Microsoft tone during the making of the film in the early 2000s can be attributed to several factors, including the United States v. Microsoft Corp. antitrust case and broader sentiments within the open-source and free software communities. Here's why there was an anti-Microsoft sentiment at that time:

    1. **United States v. Microsoft Corp. (Microsoft Antitrust Case):** The film was made in the aftermath of the United States v. Microsoft Corp. antitrust case, which was a landmark legal battle in the late 1990s. In this case, Microsoft was found guilty of engaging in anticompetitive practices, including monopolistic behavior in the software industry. Microsoft's practices, such as bundling Internet Explorer with Windows and limiting the ability of users to remove it, were seen as anti-competitive and detrimental to innovation. This case contributed to a negative perception of Microsoft as a dominant and aggressive player in the technology industry.

    2. **Open Source vs. Proprietary Software:** The film highlights the philosophy of free and open-source software as opposed to proprietary software, with figures like Richard Stallman and Linus Torvalds advocating for the former. Microsoft was known for its proprietary software products, such as Windows and Microsoft Office, which stood in contrast to the open-source ethos of freely sharing and modifying software. This ideological difference naturally created tension between the open-source community and Microsoft.

    3. **Competition in the Software Industry:** Microsoft's dominance in the software market was seen by some as stifling competition and innovation. The film likely aimed to underscore the importance of open-source alternatives like Linux and Apache, which were seen as more collaborative and community-driven efforts. By showcasing these open-source success stories, the film could be interpreted as advocating for diversity and competition in the software industry.

    4. **The Rise of Linux:** Linux, which was developed as an open-source operating system, was gaining momentum in the early 2000s as a viable alternative to Microsoft's Windows. This growth challenged Microsoft's near-monopoly in the desktop operating system market. The film's focus on Linux and its development may have been seen as a direct challenge to Microsoft's dominance.

    5. **Cultural Shift:** The film was released at a time when there was a cultural shift in the technology industry. Open source and free software were gaining recognition and becoming more mainstream. This shift was partly driven by concerns about the control exerted by large corporations like Microsoft over software and the desire for a more collaborative and open approach to software development.

    In summary, the anti-Microsoft tone in the film likely stemmed from a combination of legal actions against Microsoft, ideological differences between open source and proprietary software, concerns about monopolistic practices, and the emergence of open-source alternatives that challenged Microsoft's dominance in the software industry. It's important to note that while the film may have had an anti-Microsoft tone, it also aimed to celebrate the open-source movement and its contributions to the tech industry.

* When Bill Gates wrote his 1976 *"Open Letter to Hobbyists"*, was he justified in his complaint? Why or why not?
  * Bill Gates' 1976 "Open Letter to Hobbyists" expressed his frustration and concern regarding the widespread sharing of his company's software without compensation. In the letter, he argued that hobbyists who were using his software, particularly the Altair BASIC, should pay for it rather than freely distributing it among themselves. Whether he was justified in his complaint is a matter of perspective, and opinions on this issue may vary. Here are some arguments from both sides:

    **Arguments in Favor of Bill Gates' Complaint:**

    1. **Protecting Intellectual Property:** From a legal and intellectual property standpoint, Gates had a valid argument. Microsoft had invested time and resources in developing Altair BASIC, and they deserved compensation for their work. Copyright laws exist to protect the rights of creators, and Gates was asserting these rights.

    2. **Funding Innovation:** Gates' letter highlighted the importance of financial support for software development. He argued that if hobbyists continued to use software without paying for it, it would discourage companies like Microsoft from investing in the development of new software. In this sense, he was making a case for the economic sustainability of the software industry.

    **Arguments Against Bill Gates' Complaint:**

      1. **Hobbyist Culture:** At the time, the personal computer industry was in its infancy, and there was a strong culture of collaboration and sharing among hobbyists. Many early software developers freely shared their programs and code, viewing it as a way to advance the technology and foster innovation. Gates' letter was seen by some as an attempt to stifle this culture.

      2. **Monetization vs. Advancement:** Critics argued that Gates' focus on monetization could hinder the rapid advancement of personal computing. By freely sharing software, hobbyists were able to collectively develop and improve upon existing programs, contributing to the growth of the industry. Gates' call for payment could have slowed down this progress.

      3. **Ethical Considerations:** Some individuals believed that software should be freely shared for the common good, akin to the principles of open source and free software. They questioned the ethical implications of monetizing software in a way that restricted access to those who couldn't afford it.

    In retrospect, while Bill Gates' concerns about the distribution of Altair BASIC were understandable from a business standpoint, they were at odds with the prevailing ethos of the early personal computer era, which emphasized sharing and collaboration. Over time, the software industry evolved, and the concept of proprietary software became more commonplace, with companies like Microsoft playing a central role. Ultimately, the "Open Letter to Hobbyists" was a reflection of its time, and whether Gates was justified in his complaint depends on one's perspective and the historical context in which it was written.

* According to Eric Raymond in the movie, the adoption curve of Linux and the adoption curve the internet do what ~32:20?
  
  * Eric Raymond observed that both Linux and the internet followed adoption patterns characterized by decentralized, open, and community-driven development. In his "The Cathedral and the Bazaar" essay, he emphasized their success in gaining widespread adoption through collaboration and grassroots efforts. Raymond's insights underscored the importance of open-source and decentralized models in driving innovation and adoption in technology.

* Why did Bruce Perens help write the Open Source Definition / Debian Social Contract Standard?
  * Bruce Perens played a crucial role in writing the Open Source Definition and was one of the key figures in the open-source software movement. He contributed to defining the principles that distinguish open-source software from proprietary software. There were several reasons why Bruce Perens helped write the Open Source Definition and was involved in the development of the Debian Social Contract Standard:

    1. **Clarifying Open Source Principles:** The term "open source" was coined in the late 1990s to represent the idea of software that is released with source code that can be freely viewed, modified, and redistributed. Perens recognized the need to clarify the principles that defined open-source software to ensure a shared understanding within the software development community.

    2. **Promoting Openness and Collaboration:** Perens, like other open-source advocates, believed in the value of open and collaborative software development. He wanted to create a framework that encouraged developers to share their code openly and collaborate with others, fostering innovation and progress.

    3. **Distinguishing from Free Software:** While open source and free software share many principles, there are subtle differences in terminology and philosophy. Bruce Perens aimed to create a clear and distinct definition for open source, differentiating it from the free software movement led by figures like Richard Stallman.

    4. **Supporting the Debian Project:** Perens was involved in the Debian Project, an influential open-source operating system project. The Debian Social Contract, which includes the Debian Free Software Guidelines (DFSG), outlines the principles and values of the Debian Project. Perens' involvement in defining these principles helped guide the project's direction and commitment to open-source ideals.

    5. **Building a Broader Community:** By helping to formulate the Open Source Definition and the Debian Social Contract, Perens contributed to building a broader community of developers and users who embraced open-source software. These standards provided a framework for projects to align with open-source principles.

    In summary, Bruce Perens played a pivotal role in shaping the open-source software movement by helping to write the Open Source Definition and the Debian Social Contract Standard. His efforts were aimed at clarifying the principles of open source, promoting collaboration and openness, and providing a clear framework for developers and projects to adhere to, thereby contributing to the growth and success of open-source software.

* What were the two commercial Linux companies featured in the movie (Note-one does not exist any longer)?
  * The two commercial Linux companies featured in the movie are:

    1. **VA Linux Systems:** VA Linux Systems was a prominent commercial Linux company during the early days of Linux's commercialization. The film likely discusses the company's role in combining GNU software with standard PCs to create Unix-like workstations at a competitive price. VA Linux Systems went public with a highly successful IPO in 1999. However, the company later faced financial challenges and underwent a rebranding to VA Software and then SourceForge, focusing on software development tools and collaboration platforms. The company's transformation reflected the changing landscape of the open-source industry.

    2. **Red Hat:** Red Hat is the commercial Linux company that continues to exist and thrive in the present day. In the film, you may have heard of Michael Tiemann, who co-founded the first company based on GNU Project technology and the principles of the free software movement. Red Hat has been a key player in the open-source and Linux communities, providing enterprise-grade Linux solutions, including Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL). Red Hat has maintained its position as a leader in the open-source software industry, offering a range of products and services for businesses and organizations worldwide.

  * The commercial Linux company that no longer exists is VA Linux Systems. VA Linux Systems went through significant changes and rebranding, eventually transforming into SourceForge. The company no longer operates under the name "VA Linux Systems" and does not have a prominent presence in the Linux and open-source software market as it did in its early days. 

* What is Red Hat Linux's stock price today compared to the the price listed in the movie?  What is VA Linux's stock price today compared to the movie? (Hint VA Linux was sold and now belongs to another company, find that company's stock price.)

  * The current price of Red Hat Linux stock is $187.71. In the movie, the price was $6.25. 
  * Gamestop finally acquired Geeknet Inc. (the new name of VA Linux) for $140 million on June 2, 2015.
  * The current price of Geeknet Inc (GKNT) stock is $19.98. The company's initial public offering (IPO) in 1999 raised $132 million. The shares were offered at $30 per share, but opened for trading at $299 per share. The shares closed at $239.25 per share, which was 698% above the IPO price. This was the largest first day gain on record. 




* According to Eric S. Raymond what was the major application that needed to "flip" for opensource to become a viable enterprise solution?
  * Eric S. Raymond, in his influential essay "The Cathedral and the Bazaar," argued that for open source to become a viable enterprise solution, a major application needed to "flip." The major application he was referring to was the web server software. Specifically, the flip he mentioned was the transition from proprietary web server software to open-source alternatives.

    At the time the essay was written, the Apache HTTP Server, which is open source, was gaining prominence and rapidly becoming a dominant force in the web server software market. Apache's success demonstrated the viability of open-source software for critical enterprise-level applications.

    The flip to open-source web server software was significant because the web was becoming an essential platform for business and commerce. By adopting open source for web server software, enterprises could reduce costs, customize software to their specific needs, and benefit from the collaborative efforts of the open-source community.

    Eric S. Raymond's essay emphasized the importance of this shift in perception and adoption of open-source software within the enterprise sector, with the success of Apache serving as a prime example of open source becoming a viable and trusted solution for critical business applications.

* What was the first major commercial company to opensource a key product?  What did that product eventually become?
  * The first major commercial company to open source a key product is often considered to be Netscape Communications Corporation. In 1998, Netscape released the source code for its web browser, Netscape Communicator, under an open-source license. This move was a significant event in the history of open source and had a profound impact on the software industry.

    The product that Netscape open sourced eventually became the Mozilla project. Specifically, the browser code was used as the foundation for the Mozilla web browser, which later evolved into the Mozilla Firefox web browser. Firefox has been one of the most successful open-source web browsers and has gained a substantial user base since its inception.

    Netscape's decision to release its browser source code to the public marked a turning point in the open-source movement. It not only contributed to the growth of open-source software but also played a pivotal role in challenging the dominance of Microsoft's Internet Explorer in the web browser market, promoting competition, and fostering innovation in the web browsing space.

* How does Richard Stallman react at the end of the movie to the success of the Linux kernel to the exclusion of the GNU toolchain?

  * Richard Stallman reacted happily. It's a summary of Stallman's views and beliefs regarding the importance of software freedom and his efforts to promote free software for the betterment of society.

* What is the main difference between *"Free Software"* and *"Open Source Software"*?
  * The main difference between "Free Software" and "Open Source Software" lies in their philosophy and emphasis:

    - **Free Software:** Emphasizes ethical principles and users' freedoms, as defined by the Free Software Movement and the Free Software Foundation. It often uses copyleft licenses to ensure software remains free.

    - **Open Source Software:** Focuses on practical benefits like transparency, collaboration, and code quality. It follows the Open Source Definition set by the Open Source Initiative (OSI) and may use various licenses, including permissive ones.

    In essence, "Free Software" prioritizes ethical principles, while "Open Source Software" emphasizes practical advantages. Both promote openness and sharing of software but with different philosophies.
