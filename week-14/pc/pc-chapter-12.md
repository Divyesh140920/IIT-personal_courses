3) ~4:57 What was the challenge that led to the creation of Nginx?
    * The C10k problem, which concentrated on effectively managing a large number of concurrent connections, was the difficulty that gave rise to Nginx.

4) ~5:33 What is the main architectural difference between Nginx and Apache webservers?
    * The primary architectural distinction between the webservers Nginx and Apache is that the former has an event-driven, asynchronous architecture, while the latter is process-based and synchronous.

5) ~8:32 What are some of the main use cases for Nginx?
    * Serving static content, caching, load balancing, and reverse proxying are a few of the primary applications for Nginx.

6) ~11:00 When did Sarah get involved in Nginx?
    * It was around 2013 when Sarah Novotny first became associated with Nginx, about two months before the interview.

    * Indeed, Nginx is available in packages for Linux distributions.

13) ~53:10 Can Apache and Nginx co-exist or is it a winner take all?
    * Both Apache and Nginx can coexist, and it's frequently advantageous to use them in tandem, utilizing their individual strengths for various web serving duties, including handling static material and more complicated processing jobs.
