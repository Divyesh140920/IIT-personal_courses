Watch this video with Professor Brian Kernighan [History of grep](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfOnGZUZDk&t=1s) and answer the following questions.

* ~0:11 What does the grep program do?
  * The widely-known UNIX command 'grep' enables you to look for certain text patterns in one or more files as well as in input from other programs like Unix pipelines. It is a tool for text pattern finding and filtering, which can be difficult or impossible to do with a text editor.
* ~1:11 What was the first computer that Unix ran on?
  * A PDP-11 was the first computer to run Unix. Around 1970â€“1971, when Unix was first developed, it was probably running on a PDP-11/20. In addition to having relatively little memory (between 32K and 64K bytes), these machines also had very little secondary storage (a few megabytes of disk capacity). Despite these limitations, this device was used to create and run Unix. The early development of Unix and its history were greatly aided by the PDP-11 line of machines.
* ~1:40 Why did the original Unix software tend to be "simple and straight forward?"
  * The original Unix software tended to be "simple and straightforward" for several reasons:
     1. Limited Computing Resources
     2. Personal Preferences of Developers
     3. Efficiency
     4. Focus on Building Blocks
     5. Ease of Maintenance  
  * In conclusion, a combination of hardware constraints, developer preferences, an emphasis on efficiency, a modular approach, and the necessity for maintainability contributed to the original Unix software's simplicity and clarity.
* ~2:01 What was the first Unix text editor called?
  * The original Unix text editor was known as "ed." It was a basic text editor that was used on early Unix computers. "ed" was primarily created by Ken Thompson, and it was built to operate within the limitations of the time's meager processing power and paper-based terminals.
* ~2:30 When designing text editors in the early 70's what didn't they have that we have now?
  * When creating text editors in the early 1970s, they lacked today's sophisticated computer and display capabilities. Key constraints were as follows:
     1. Limited Computing Power
     2. Paper-Based Terminals
     3. No Video Display Terminals
     4. Minimal Memory
     5. Limited Secondary Storage
* ~4:09 What does the "ed" command `1,$p` accomplish?
  * The "ed" command 1,$p accomplishes the following:

     * `1`: This specifies the starting point of the operation, which is the first line in the file.

     * `$`: This represents the ending point, which is a shorthand for the last line in the file.

     * `p`: This is the command to "print." When combined with the range 1,$, it means to print all lines from the first line to the last line of the file.

    So, 1,$p in "ed" will print the entire content of the file, displaying all the lines in the file.
* ~4:35 What is a Regular Expression?
  * Regular expressions, often known as "regex" or "regexp," are patterns that specify a collection of strings. It is an effective tool for analyzing text and looking for similar patterns in text. A search pattern is defined by regular expressions, which are made up of a collection of characters and symbols.
* ~5:26 What does a star or asterik (shift+8) mean in Shell meta-characters?
  * The asterisk (*) is a metacharacter in Shell that denotes "zero or more occurrences" of the preceding character or group in regular expressions. It's frequently used to find patterns where a certain character or group can appear once, twice, three times, or even zero times. The asterisk operates as follows:

  * `*`(asterisk): Matches zero or more occurrences of the preceding character or group.
* ~7:30 Who wrote the grep command and how long did it take?
  * One of the Unix pioneers, Ken Thompson, developed the 'grep' command in the beginning in response to a request from his colleague Lee McMahon. Lee McMahon told Ken Thompson that he required a tool to look for certain patterns in a vast collection of documents, especially the Federalist Papers.

  To satisfy McMahon's request, Ken Thompson created the 'grep' command as soon as possible. The process of developing 'grep' was quick, and Thompson had it ready for usage in a relatively short amount of time.
* ~7:42 What is the explantion of what the grep command does?
  * In Unix, the 'grep' tool is used to look for text patterns within one or more files. Users can search for and view files' lines that match a given regular expression pattern.
  1. Pattern Matching
  2. File Search
  3. Output Display
  4. Regular Expressions
  5. Options and Flags  
  *In conclusion, the grep command is an effective Unix text-searching tool that enables users to locate and extract certain information from text files based on user-defined patterns or regular expressions.
* ~8:04 What does the character `g` mean in regular expressions?
  * The letter "g" does not have a particular or distinctive meaning by itself in regular expressions. Instead, the context and the regular expression engine in use determine how it should be interpreted. However, 'g' might be interpreted as a literal character in other instances and not have any particular meaning.

  * 'g' by itself is treated as a literal character and is used to match the character "g" in the input text in some regular expression engines, such as those found in programming languages like JavaScript or Python. It doesn't serve any unique purposes or have any special meaning.
* ~8:33 Why is the program named `grep`?
  * The word "grep" stands for "Global Regular Expression Print," hence the program is called "grep." It is a command-line tool that searches for text patterns (regular expressions) in files on operating systems that are similar to Unix. The word "grep" refers to a command that searches for and prints lines in one or more files that match a given regular expression pattern.

   * The term "grep" has its roots in the early Unix era, specifically in Ken Thompson's private application for searching files using regular expressions. Later, this tool was made available to the general public, and the "grep" command was born.
* ~9:00 Describe the assignment the Professor Kernighan gave to his students
  * The professor gave his pupils the job of creating a C program from the 'ed' text editor's source code that would mimic the functionality of 'grep.' The assignment's specifics are as follows:
     1. Source code conversion: The 'ed' text editor's source code, which was initially built in C, was provided to the students. There were about 1800 lines in this source code.
     2. Goal: The main goal of the assignment was to convert the 'ed' source code into a C program that would serve as 'grep.'
     3. Benefits: Professor Kernighan cited two benefits the pupils enjoyed: 

      * Because 'grep' already existed, they were aware of the intended behavior and were therefore able to achieve their objective.
      * Compared to the original 'grep' written in PDP-11 assembly language, the 'ed' source code had already been translated into C, making it simpler to deal with.
     4. Results: The task required the students to modify and reuse the 'ed' source code in order to mimic the capabilities of 'grep'. They got a chance to practice their coding skills in a real-world setting and discover how fundamental Unix utilities are created.
  Overall, the purpose of this assignment was to instruct students on how to alter programs, comprehend existing code, and complete a particular software task within a set amount of time.
